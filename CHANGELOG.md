# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-30

Adds `drag-to-pin-session` to the pack.

### Added

- **drag-to-pin-session:** the Pinned section of the Sessions sidebar becomes a drag container. Drag a session row in to pin it, drag a pinned row out into Sessions to unpin it. Desktop-only, hot-reloads, no rebuild.

### Changed

- Pack description and README now cover four plugins.
- `hermes-awesome-plugins-sync` mirrors `drag-to-pin-session`, and relocates a root `plugin.js` to `desktop/plugin.js` for any plugin rather than only `better-colors`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-30

First pack. Three Hermes Agent plugins, pinned to exact SHAs.

### Added

- **provider-status:** quota chips across providers, Grok/Codex OAuth, key-pool rotation, and per-key reset-day rotation.
- **hermes-break:** `/break` and `/again` kill a hung spawn without aborting the turn. `/again` reissues that call once.
- **better-colors:** session list appearance. Color and bold titles, extra Appearance colors, idle-bullet glyphs.

### Upgrade notes

- Hermes Agent `>= 0.3`.
- Install with `hermes plugins pack install` of the raw `hermes-pack.yaml` URL. There is no GitHub Release for this pack.
